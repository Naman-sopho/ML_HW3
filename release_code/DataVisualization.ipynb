    "\n",
    "##### 1. Data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we're going to examine our training data. This code is largely written for you, as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to examine your data before you start training your models on it, so that you have a good idea of what kind of data your working on, and what kinds of errors you should look out for.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Training Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second step, we're going to visualize the training and validation losses of our models as we train them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very important aspect of training deep models. Looking at a graph of these 2 losses can tell you a lot about how well your model is learning what you want it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Hyperparameter Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step of visualization is hyperparameter search.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many hyperparameters in a typical DNN. How do we know which values to set for each of these parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is, there's really no good answer. The best we can do is run the model multiple times on different values, and pick the ones that do the best on our development data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll take turns fixing all of our hyperparameters except one, and examining how our performance changes as we change that one parameter. Ideally, to be confident in our results, we should get a \"U\" shape (for scalar parameters), which indicates we've examined the full span of which values work for that hyperparameter, when the other values are fixed.\n"

    "In this next section of visualization, we're going to visualize the effects of specific hyperparameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once we have dev accuracy for each setting, we can plot it and examine the learning trends as we sweep over that hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, this upside-down \"U\" and it's maximum value might only be true in the setting where all of our other hyperparameters are frozen. If we change those, then the sweep we just did might not be correct anymore. However, if we've chosen good values to freeze our other hyperparameters with, then we should learn something about the hyperparameter we're examining.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: You will be training a lot of models in this section. If you set up the sweeps correctly, running them should take a while. You might want to leave some time to run these experiments (go grab lunch or a coffee after you kick them off).**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this part a number of ways. The easiest way is write a script that runs ```main.py``` multiple times and passes in a different value for the hyperparameter in the command line arguments. Then you can manually grab look at performance of each model from it's output, and plot that in this notebook. This also allows you to save each model in a different spot, so you always have the best model after a sweep. This is nice, because now you don't have to retrain the model to run it on test data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way is to build a training loop in the cells below, and just run through that loop for each value of the hyperparameter. This might be a bit more work, but now you can directly store the dev accuracy of each run in the notebook, which migth make it easier to plot. It's up to you!\n",
